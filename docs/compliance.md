# Compliance and Governance Notes

Shadow Stax AI operates in high-risk domains (adult content, financial systems, gambling-related prediction). This repository is an early scaffold and does not claim compliance with any regulation or jurisdiction.

High-level commitments:

- Adult-content products must implement strict content boundaries, consent-aware UX patterns, and clear usage policies before launch.
- Crypto trading systems must include risk controls, auditability, and user protections prior to any real-money exposure.
- Sports betting prediction systems must avoid facilitating or automating wagering, and should incorporate responsible gaming guidelines.

These notes are directional only. Legal review, jurisdictional compliance, and formal governance processes are required before any production deployment.
