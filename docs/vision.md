# Shadow Stax AI Vision

Shadow Stax AI is building a multi-vertical platform for applied AI systems that can scale across distinct, regulated domains. The initial focus spans three verticals:

- Adult-content AI chat experiences with strong safety boundaries and platform controls.
- Crypto trading systems for research, training, and execution pipelines.
- Sports betting prediction systems that separate data collection, modeling, and downstream services.

Long-term intent is to unify shared infrastructure, data schemas, and operational tooling while keeping each vertical's product surface independent and compliant. This repository is the baseline scaffold to align teams on a common foundation before models, integrations, or production infrastructure are introduced.
